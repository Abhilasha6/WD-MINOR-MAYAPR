                    <p>Taj Mahal, also spelled Tadj Mahall, mausoleum complex in Agra, western Uttar Pradesh state,
                        northern
                        India. The Taj Mahal was built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahān (reigned 1628-58) to immortalize
                        his
                        wife Mumtaz Mahal (“Chosen One of the Palace”), who died in childbirth in 1631, having been the
                        emperor's inseparable companion since their marriage in 1612. India's most famous and widely
                        recognized building, it is situated in the eastern part of the city on the southern (right) bank
                        of
                        the Yamuna (Jumna) River. Agra Fort (Red Fort), also on the right bank of the Yamuna, is about 1
                        mile (1.6 km) west of the Taj Mahal.In its harmonious proportions and its fluid incorporation of
                        decorative elements, the Taj Mahal is distinguished as the finest example of Mughal
                        architecture, a
                        blend of Indian, Persian, and Islamic styles. Other attractions include twin mosque buildings
                        (placed symmetrically on either side of the mausoleum), lovely gardens, and a museum. One of the
                        most beautiful structural compositions in the world, the Taj Mahal is also one of the world's
                        most
                        iconic monuments, visited by millions of tourists each year. The complex was designated a UNESCO
                        World Heritage site in 1983.

                    <p>Red Fort, also called Lal Qalʿah, also spelled Lal Kila or Lal Qila, Mughal fort in Old Delhi,
                        India.
                        It was built by Shah Jahān in the mid-17th century and remains a major tourist attraction. The
                        fort
                        was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2007.The fort's massive red sandstone walls,
                        which
                        stand 75 feet (23 metres) high, enclose a complex of palaces and entertainment halls, projecting
                        balconies, baths and indoor canals, and geometrical gardens, as well as an ornate mosque. Among
                        the
                        most famous structures of the complex are the Hall of Public Audience (Diwan-i-ʿAm), which has
                        60
                        red sandstone pillars supporting a flat roof, and the Hall of Private Audience (Diwan-i-Khas),
                        which
                        is smaller and has a pavilion of white marble.</p>

                        Quṭb Mīnār, among the tallest minarets in Asia, built in Delhi beginning at the turn of the 13th
                        century by Quṭb al-Dīn Aibak and completed by his successor, Iltutmish.As the mīnār (tower) to
                        the
                        Qūwat-ul-Islām mosque, the Quṭb Mīnār serves the traditional purpose of being the place from
                        which
                        the faithful are called to prayer. An inscription on the tower indicates that it also served as
                        a
                        victory monument.Damaged by lightning and earthquakes in the 14th and 15th centuries, the tower
                        was
                        rebuilt and repaired by local rulers at the time. In the early 16th century, the Lodī ruler
                        Sikandar
                        undertook more-extensive restoration while expanding its top two tiers. The Quṭb Mīnār, as it
                        stands
                        today, is a 72.5-metre (238-foot) fluted sandstone tower with copious marble inlays. Projecting
                        balconies separate five successive stories, each of which is marked by bands of richly carved
                        inscriptions from the Qur'ān. The lowest three tiers are made of alternating red and buff
                        sandstone,
                        the fourth and fifth of marble and sandstone. The tower tapers from 14.3 metres (47 feet) in
                        diameter at the base to 2.75 metres (9 feet) at the top.

                        Gateway of India, monument in Mumbai that was completed in 1924.Situated on the Apollo Bunder
                        overlooking the Arabian Sea, the Gateway of India was designed to commemorate the visit in 1911
                        of
                        King George V and Queen Mary, who had been en route to the durbar being held in Delhi to
                        celebrate
                        their coronation as emperor and empress of India.Built of honey-colored basalt, the Gateway of
                        India
                        resembles a conventional triumphal arch in concept, but architecturally it is Indo-Saracenic in
                        style, modeled on 16th-century Gujarati work. This absorption of Mughal influences was
                        consciously
                        done, with a view to suggesting the link with earlier rulers and thus arguing for the legitimacy
                        of
                        British colonial rule. Intricate latticework decorates the walls, and four turrets surround an
                        imposing central dome that is 50 feet (15 m) in diameter and rises to 85 feet (26 m) high. Side
                        chambers and halls were added to accommodate civic receptions. The building was opened to the
                        public
                        on December 4, 1924, by the viceroy of India, Rufus Isaacs, earl of Reading.

                        Konark, also spelled Konarak, Konarka, or Kanarak, historic town, east-central Odisha state,
                        eastern
                        India, on the Bay of Bengal coast. It is famous for its 13th-century Surya Deula (or Surya
                        Deul),
                        popularly known as the Sun Temple.The town's name is derived from the Sanskrit words kona
                        (“corner”)
                        and arka (“sun”), a reference to the temple, which was dedicated to the Hindu sun god Surya. It
                        was
                        designed to represent his chariot, with 12 huge carved stone wheels and 7 stone horses around
                        its
                        base. The Surya Deula is about 100 feet (30 metres) high and would have surpassed 200 feet (60
                        metres) in height at its completion.The town and the temple are associated with the legend of
                        Samba,
                        the son of the Hindu deity Krishna, who was cured of leprosy by the sun god's blessings.
                        Evidence
                        suggests that the temple was built by Narasimha I (reigned 1238-64) about 1250. It represents
                        the
                        culmination of the Orissan school of temple architecture. Formerly called the Black Pagoda
                        because
                        of the many shipwrecks that occurred off the coast, the temple was used as a navigation landmark
                        by
                        European mariners sailing to Calcutta (now Kolkata). From the 15th to the 17th century, the
                        temple
                        was sacked various times by Muslim armies. By the 19th century, much of the temple had been
                        weathered and ruined. Under British rule, sections of the temple complex were restored, but much
                        of
                        it remained in ruins. The complex was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1984.

                        Jagannatha, (Sanskrit: “Lord of the World”) form under which the Hindu god Krishna is worshipped
                        at
                        Puri, Odisha (Orissa), and at Ballabhpur, a suburb of Shrirampur, West Bengal state, India. The
                        12th-century temple of Jagannatha in Puri towers above the town. In its sanctuary, wooden images
                        represent Jagannatha, his brother Balabhadra (Balarama), and his sister Subhadra. Modern
                        representations made in Puri of the 10 avatars (incarnations) of Vishnu often show Jagannatha as
                        one
                        of the 10 in place of the more usually accepted Buddha.The most important of the numerous yearly
                        festivals is the Chariot Festival (Rathayatra), which takes place on the second day of the
                        bright
                        fortnight of Ashadha (June-July). The image is placed in a wagon so heavy that the efforts of
                        hundreds of devotees are required to move it, and it is dragged through deep sand to the country
                        house of the god. The English word juggernaut, with its connotation of a force crushing whatever
                        is
                        in its path, is derived from this
                        festival.

                        The Jantar Mantar is located in the modern city of New Delhi. It consists of 13 architectural
                        astronomy instruments. The site is one of five built by Maharaja Jai Singh II of Jaipur, from
                        1724
                        onwards, as he was given by Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah the task of revising the calendar and
                        astronomical tables. There is a plaque fixed on one of the structures in the Jantar Mantar
                        observatory in New Delhi that was placed there in 1910 mistakenly dating the construction of the
                        complex to the year 1710. Later research, though, suggests 1724 as the actual year of
                        construction.
                        The primary purpose of the observatory was to compile astronomical tables, and to predict the
                        times
                        and movements of the sun, moon and planets. Some of these purposes nowadays would be classified
                        asastronomy. Completed in 1724, the Delhi Jantar Mantar had decayed considerably by 1867.

                        Hawa Mahal, palace in the Indian city of Jaipur that was designed by Lal Chand Ustad and
                        completed
                        in 1799.Regarded as one of the iconic symbols of the state of Rajasthan, the Hawa Mahal (Palace
                        of
                        Winds) sits in the center of Rajasthan's capital, Jaipur. Built as an extension to the women's
                        chambers of the city palace, it was intended as a viewing screen. Through this screen—a kind of
                        architectural veil—women of the royal household could freely view the bazaar and its vibrant
                        proceedings unseen. The term mahal in this context is almost misleading, as the building was
                        never
                        meant to serve as a residence. The five-story building is actually quite shallow, with the top
                        three
                        stories being barely a room deep and containing chambers in which the women sat.In keeping with
                        the
                        visual language of the “Pink City” of Jaipur, the Hawa Mahal is built entirely in red sandstone,
                        which in the sunlight glows with a pink hue. It is often identified as the world's tallest

                        Bengal,
                        India. Situated on the eastern bank of the Hooghly River, the presiding deity of the temple is
                        Bhavatarini, a form of Parashakti Adya Kali, otherwise known as Adishakti Kalika.The temple was
                        built in 1855 by Rani Rashmoni, a Zamindar, philanthropist and a devotee of Kali. The temple is
                        known for its association with Ramakrishna and Ma Sarada Devi, mystics of 19th Century Bengal.
                        The main temple was inspired by Navaratna style Radhakanta temple, built by Ramnath Mondal of
                        Tollygunge. The temple compound, apart from the nine-spired main temple, contains a large
                        courtyard surrounding the temple, with rooms along the boundary walls. There are twelve shrines

                        The great temple of Rameswaram was built in the 17th century on the traditional site said to be
                        sanctified by the god Rama's footprints when he crossed the island on his journey to rescue his
                        wife, Sita, from the demon Ravana.The temple is built on rising ground above a small lake.
                        Quadrangular in shape, it is about 1,000 feet (305 metres) long and 650 feet (198 metres) wide.
                        It
                        has a 100-foot- (30-metre-) high gopura, or tower gateway, but the temple's outstanding features
                        are
                        its 700-foot- (213-metre-) long pillared halls, which open into richly decorated transverse
                        galleries. The temple is perhaps the finest example of Dravidian architecture. Sacred to both
                        Vaishnavas and Shaivas, it is the most holy place for Hindus in India after the city of
                        Varanasi.

                        Harmandir Sahib, Harmandir also spelled Harimandir, also called Darbar Sahib (Punjabi: “Sacred
                        Audience”) or Golden Temple, the chief gurdwara, or house of worship, of Sikhism and the Sikhs'
                        most
                        important pilgrimage site. It is located in the city of Amritsar, Punjab state, northwestern
                        India.The first Harmandir Sahib was built in 1604 by Arjan, the fifth Sikh Guru, who
                        symbolically
                        had it placed on a lower level so that even the humblest had to step down to enter it. He also
                        included entrances on all four sides, signifying that it was open to worshippers of all castes
                        and
                        creeds. The foundation stone was laid by Mian Mīr, a Muslim divine of Lahore (now in Pakistan).
                        The
                        temple was destroyed several times by Afghan invaders and was finally rebuilt in marble and
                        copper
                        overlaid with gold foil during the reign (1801-39) of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. The structure thus
                        became known as the Golden Temple.

                        Hampi (Kannada: ಹಂಪೆ, Hampe) refers to a village in northern Karnataka. The name "Hampi" comes
                        from
                        the anglicized version of the Kannada Hampe (derived from Pampa, the ancient name for the
                        Tungabhadra river). Over the years, it has also been referred to as Vijayanagara and
                        Virupakshapura
                        (from Virupaksha, the patron deity of the Vijayanagara rulers).Hampi also goes by the name "The
                        City
                        of Ruins." UNESCO has designated the Vijayanagara ruins as a World Heritage Site within the
                        Group of
                        Monuments at Hampi title.Hampi identifies with the mythological Kishkindha, the Vanara (monkey)
                        kingdom which finds mention in the Ramayana. The first historical settlements in Hampi date to 1
                        C.E. Hampi formed one of the centers of the capital of the Vijayanagara Empire from 1336 to
                        1565.
                        Muslim emperors destroyed it. The founders of Hampi selected the site for its strategic
                        location,
                        bounded by the torrential Tungabhadra river on one side and surrounded by defensible hills on
                        the
                        other three sides.
